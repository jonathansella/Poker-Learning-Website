                <p>Texas Hold'em is the most popular variant of poker, combining skill, strategy, and psychology. Each player starts with two private cards (hole cards) and uses them in combination with five community cards to make the best possible five-card poker hand.</p>
                <p>The game is played in a series of betting rounds, where players can check, bet, call, raise, or fold. The goal is to win chips by either having the best hand at showdown or making other players fold before reaching showdown.</p>
